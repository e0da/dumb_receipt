Queries
-------

### POST

* [/registration](/registration) gives you sample registration feedback
  * Most any POST request will result in success and give you a dummy
    auth_token
  * Setting a paramter called fail (i.e. `&fail=true`) will cause
    authentication to fail

To test post requests, you can use `curl`. Here are examples for success and
failure of registration (copy the _/registration_ URL above):

    curl http://localhost:9393/registration -d ''
    curl http://localhost:9393/registration -d 'fail=true'

### GET

* [/sync](/sync) will give you sample _sync_ data.
* [/offers](/offers) will give you sample _offers_ data.
* [/receipts](/receipts) will give you sample _receipts_ data.
